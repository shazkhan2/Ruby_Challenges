# Now that the basics are covered, we are going to use a typical workflow
# for the rest of the lessons. The class being tested will be located in
# a different file.

# The file order to complete this lesson:
# 1. Familarize yourself with the class in lib/drink.rb
# 2. Complete spec/drink_spec.rb

# If you are using VS Code, you can split the screen to see both files at
# the same time (view menu -> editor layout).
